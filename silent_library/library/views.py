# File: silent_library/library/views.py
# Purpose: This file contains the view functions for the 'library' app.
# Views are Python functions (or classes) that take a web request and return a web response.
# They encapsulate the logic required to process a user's request, interact with models (database),
# process forms, and then render a template (HTML page) or redirect to another URL.
# This file handles user authentication, book display, searching, user profiles, and admin functionalities.

# Django shortcuts provide convenient functions for common tasks.
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404
    # render: Combines a given template with a given context dictionary and returns an HttpResponse object with that rendered text.
    # redirect: Returns an HttpResponseRedirect to the appropriate URL for the arguments passed.
    # get_object_or_404: Calls get() on a given model manager, but it raises Http404 instead of the modelâ€™s DoesNotExist exception.

# Django's authentication system components.
from django.contrib.auth import login, logout, authenticate, update_session_auth_hash
    # login: Logs a user in.
    # logout: Logs a user out.
    # authenticate: Attempts to authenticate a user.
    # update_session_auth_hash: Updates the session hash after a password change to keep the user logged in.

# Decorators for restricting access to views.
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test
    # login_required: Redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated.
    # user_passes_test: Checks if a user passes a given test (a callable that takes a User object).

# Utility for reversing URL names to actual paths.
from django.urls import reverse_lazy

# Django's messaging framework for displaying one-time notifications to users.
from django.contrib import messages

# Function for sending emails.
from django.core.mail import send_mail

# Importing models from the current app's models.py.
from .models import Book, Author, Genre, Loan, Review # Removed Genre as it's not directly used in views here, but good to keep if planned.

# Importing forms from the current app's forms.py.
# Note: The import from .forms was duplicated later in the original file; consolidated here.
from .forms import (
    UserRegistrationForm, UserLoginForm, UserEditForm,
    UserEditUsernameEmailForm, UserEditPasswordForm,
    BookForm, ReviewForm
)

# Q objects are used for building complex database queries (e.g., with OR conditions).
